      </h2> 

      <p>This project is the outcome of a <span class="bold">4 year investigation</span>, 
      during which I was able to capture several shots of the 4 ring leaders of the infamous 
      <span class="bold">cat fighting gangs</span> that have taken over the roofs around 
      my bunker.</p>

      <p>More than a thousand nights of <span class="bold">hellish screams</span> still haunt my dreams.</p>

      <p>Over the course of the investigation I've built a dossier on these ruthless Cats.</p>

      <p>This series consists of the initial release containing the 4 mugshots of the 
      known <span class="bold">Cat Ring Leaders</span>:</p>

      <p><span class="bold">BLANCHI, FATSO, SLEEPER & SWIRLZ.</span></p>

      <p>Further collateral will be released, including full body shots and
      a suite of spectral analyses.</p>

      a famous <span class="bold">1958 Brussels Grand Prix</span> winner lens 
      <span class="bold">used by the KGB during the Cold War</span> for espionage operations. 
      It has since travelled <span class="bold">3 continents and over 9000km</span> to make 
      its way here, to bear witness to these <span class="bold">vicious Cats</span>.</p>

      <p>The grainy nature of a <span class="bold">state of the art</span> 1950's manual 
      long distance telephoto lens can be appreciated. Those well versed in the subject can 
      also observe the compression of a very long distance focal range and the artifacts
      of the <span class="bold">mirror lens technology</span> in the <span class="bold">bokeh</span> 
      and <span class="bold">"restless" blur</span> of the out of focus areas.</p>

      <p class="warn">I am hereby releasing these mugshots to spread awareness: these Cats are on the loose.
