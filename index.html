    <h5>### Cat Ring Leaders</h5>

    <p>+ This project is the outcome of a 4 year investigation, during which
    I was able to capture several shots of the 4 ring leaders of the
    infamous cat fighting gangs that have taken over the roofs around
    my bunker at the time.</p>
    <p>+ More than a thousand nights of hellish screams still haunt
    my dreams.</p>
    <p>+ Over the course of the investigation I've built a dossier on these
    ruthless Cats.</p>
    <p>+ This series consists of the initial release containing the 4 mugshots of
    the known Cat Ring Leaders: Blanchi, Fatso, Swirlz \& Sleeper.</p>
    <p>+ Further collateral will be released, including full body shots and
    a suite of spectral analyses.</p>
    <p>+ All shots during this investigation were taken using the USSR made Maksutov MTO-500mm F8 mirror
    telephoto manual lens, a famous 1958 Brussels Grand Prix winner lens used by
    the KGB during the Cold War for espionage operations. It has since
    travelled 3 continents and over 9000km to make its way here, to bear
    witness to these vicious Cats.</p>
    <p>+ The grainy nature of a state of the art 1950's manual long distance telephoto
    lens can be appreciated. Those well versed in the subject can also
    observe the compression of a very long distance focal range and the artifacts
    of the mirror lens technology in the bokeh and "restless" blur of
    the out of focus areas.</p>
    <p>+ These NFTs include 100% claiming rights to the rewards resulting
    of the capture of these criminals. It also includes full access
    rights to the original unedited RAW files, for further investigation,
    memetic research \& production. (NOTE: claiming capture
    rewards works 100% correctly 40% of the times. The photographer
    is not responsible for absent rewards or any legal "misnomer".)</p>
    <p>+ BEWARE, these shots were taken from a very safe distance and using
    proper technology and safety procedures. If you happen to cross paths
    with any of of these deviants, be advised to mantain a safe distance
    and avoid meeting their gaze.</p>
    <p>+ I am hereby releasing these mugshots to spread awareness: these Cats are on the loose.
    I believe the public can not sleep safe again until these Cats are
    brought to justice, and made to pay the gas.</p>
    <p>+ You are especially advised to stay away from BLANCHI.</p>
